My name is **Jakob Klocker**, online known as **Schnee**.
I started this blog in **January 2026** to document software projects,
CTF challenges and crackme write-ups.

## Interests
- Reverse engineering
- Binary exploitation
- Hypervisors & kernel internals
- Anti-cheat and game security
- Low-level systems & performance-oriented code

## Writing
I aim to publish a new post roughly once per week, focusing
on hands-on analysis and practical techniques.
